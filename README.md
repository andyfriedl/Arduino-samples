# Arduino-samples
Samples of Arduino snippets and projects that I have created or modified. Please excuse any formatting and code sloppiness. I'm sure there are better ways to do things but this my attempt of diving in and learning as I go. Some of the code is found from searches. I will try and credit the source when I can find it.

###LED 8x8 matrix.

Samples include support for .08" Miniature 8x8 Red LED Matrix from Adafruit using the max7219. Also support for Adafruit Small 1.2" 8x8 LED Matrix w/I2C Backpack. Animations and scrolling text.

###NeoPixel/NeoPixel Ring

Samples were based on a 12 pixel NeoPixel ring. This can be changed to fix your number of pixels.
