All of this is a work in progress. Just wanted to share what I have. Most of these are just visual effects.

- 2001 = Folder contains images that replicate the screens from the movie 2001.
- barGraph.ino
- bounceBall.ino = Gravity pulls dot down and bounces lower and lower.
- bugDrawing.ino = Draw a random dot and move randomly up, down, right or left.
- convert-int-to-string-and-loop.ino
- dots.ino = Draw random dots and delete random dots.
- font-test.ino
- gameOfLife.ino = a classic
- move-in-circle.ino = Moves an object in a circle.
- move-in-curves.ino = Moves an object in a curving loop.
- pongBall.ino =  Like pong but the ball just bounces off all sides.
- radar.ino - Draws a line from the center and works its way round the screen. Like a Radar sweep.
- rotate-just-cube.ino - Extracted out just the cube rotate from the demo.
- terrain.ino - Random generated columns. Kind of looks like terrain.
- time.ino
- tvout-lines-cols-dots.ino - All the things on the screen.
- uscTest.ino - UI test
